Passionate iOS and tvOS developer since 2010, I focus on crafting delightful and robust applications targeting Apple devices.

- 🇨🇭 I am currently working at [RTS](https://www.rts.ch) (Radio Télévision Suisse), which is part of the [SRG SSR (Swiss Broadcasting Corporation)](https://www.srgssr.ch/en/who-we-are/organisation).
- 👷‍♂️ I am working on the Play SRG platform, which is how the SRG SSR and all its business units ([RSI](https://www.rsi.ch), [RTR](https://www.rtr.ch), [RTS](https://www.rts.ch), [SRF](https://www.srf.ch) and [SWI](https://www.swissinfo.ch)) provide public access to the audio and video content they publish.
- 📽 I am also one of the main contributors of the SRG SSR player which is used in almost all the apps we publish. In other workds I know `AVKit` and `AVFoundation` pretty well.
- 🧑‍💻 I nowadays write code in Swift, though I still maintain Objective-C code on a regular basis.
- 📚 I currently write iOS and tvOS apps using a combination of SwiftUI and UIKit for user interface work, with the help of Combine and reactive programming to drive user interface updates.
- 🧰 I enjoy creating SDKs with simple, expressive and well documented APIs.
- 💡 I share my knowledge through [in-depth technical articles I publish on my blog](https://defagos.github.io).
- 👀 Wanna have a look at the code I write? Then check the repositories of the [application](https://github.com/SRGSSR/playsrg-apple) and [player](https://github.com/SRGSSR/srgletterbox-apple) I am working on, they are public!
