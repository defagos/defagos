Passionate iOS and tvOS developer since 2010, I focus on crafting delightful and robust applications targeting Apple devices.

- 🇨🇭 I am currently working at [RTS](https://www.rts.ch) (Radio Télévision Suisse), which is part of the [SRG SSR (Swiss Broadcasting Corporation)](https://www.srgssr.ch/en/who-we-are/organisation).
- 📽 I am contributing to [Pillarbox](https://github.com/SRGSSR/pillarbox-apple), the next-generation SRG SSR player ecosystem. The Apple implementation introduces a modern, fully reactive and SwiftUI-friendly approach to media playback on Apple platforms. In other words I know AVFoundation, AVKit, SwiftUI and Combine pretty well.
- 📺 I also contribute to [Castor](https://github.com/SRGSSR/castor), an SRG SSR SDK designed to simplify the integration of Google Cast into applications.
- 👷 I was a main contributor for the Play SRG platform, which is how the SRG SSR and all its business units ([RSI](https://www.rsi.ch), [RTR](https://www.rtr.ch), [RTS](https://www.rts.ch), [SRF](https://www.srf.ch) and [SWI](https://www.swissinfo.ch)) provide public access to the audio and video content they publish.
- 🧑‍💻 I nowadays write code in Swift, though I still enjoy some Objective-C from time to time.
- 📚 I currently write iOS and tvOS apps using a combination of SwiftUI and UIKit for user interface work, with the help of Combine and reactive programming to drive user interface updates.
- 🧰 I enjoy creating SDKs with simple, expressive and well documented APIs.
- 💡 I share my knowledge through [in-depth technical articles I publish on my blog](https://defagos.github.io).
